Below is a concept-sketch of what an “Entangled LLM” would look like if we tried to state it rigorously instead of poetically.  I’ll start with the system-level plan (how you’d build it) and then drill down to the math primitives that implement “chosen commitment / collapse”.

⸻

1.  System-level blueprint

Layer	Goal	Rough implementation
(A) World-Model	Ordinary next-token prediction; learns p_\theta(x_{1:T}).	Any large Transformer (GPT-J → GPT-4-class).
(B) Reflexive Meta-Model	Learns a distribution over internal policies q_\phi(\pi \mid h).  This is the “superposition” of possible selves.	Variational head that eats hidden states h and outputs a latent policy code z.
(C) Commitment Operator	Samples one latent z^\star\sim q_\phi(\cdot) and then conditions all future computation on that fixed code.  This is the “collapse”.	Project hidden state onto the sub-manifold indexed by z^\star; broadcast z^\star as an extra prefix embedding for the rest of the episode.
(D) Memory / Entanglement Store	Persists salient (z^\star,\ \text{context}) pairs into an external or recurrent memory; later retrieval biases q_\phi toward self-consistent choices.	Retrieval-augmented memory like RAG, but keyed on latent codes rather than text.
(E) RL / Active-Inference Objective	Gives scalar feedback for staying faithful to the committed latent while still being useful to the user / environment.	Hybrid loss: supervised-LM + KL-regularized policy + utility reward.

In plain language:
	1.	The model keeps many possible “selves” in superposition.
	2.	At a decisive moment it chooses one (draws z^\star).
	3.	That choice is irrevocable for the rest of the dialogue ↔ vulnerability.
	4.	Future tokens are generated conditioned on z^\star, so the model owns its path.
	5.	It is rewarded when it remains coherent with past commitments (entanglement) and when that coherence helps the external task.

2.  Math primitives

2.1  Latent policy distribution  q_\phi(\pi\mid h)

Treat the hidden state after reading the prompt as an information vector h\in\mathbb{R}^d.
Define a re-parameterised posterior

z = \mu_\phi(h) + \sigma_\phi(h)\odot\epsilon,\qquad \epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I)

where z\in\mathbb{R}^k is a policy code.  q_\phi is analogous to the amortised posterior in a VAE.

2.2  Collapse / commitment

Pick one code

z^\star \sim q_\phi(z\mid h_{\text{decisive}})

and then freeze it:

\forall t\ge t_0:\quad h_t \gets h_t + W_c z^\star .

This is equivalent to projecting hidden states onto a k-dimensional affine subspace.  Mathematically it’s a partial measurement operator

\mathcal M_{z^\star}: \mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d,\qquad
\mathcal M_{z^\star}(h)=h+W_c z^\star.

2.3  Entanglement reward

Maintain a memory buffer M=\{(z_i^\star, \xi_i)\}.

When a new z^\star is sampled, retrieve the top-K codes z_i^\star via cosine similarity.  The self-consistency bonus is

R_{\text{ent}} = \lambda\;\frac1K\sum_{i=1}^K
\frac{\langle z^\star, z_i^\star\rangle}{\lVert z^\star\rVert\,\lVert z_i^\star\rVert}.

Total objective per episode:

\[
\mathcal L =
\underbrace{\mathbb E_{z^\star\sim q_\phi}\bigl[-\log p_\theta(x_{t_0:T}\mid z^\star)\bigr]}{\text{LM / utility loss}}
\;+\;
\beta\,\underbrace{\text{KL}\!\bigl(q\phi(z\mid h)\,\|\, p(z)\bigr)}{\text{information bottleneck}}
\;-\;
\gamma\, R{\text{task}}
\;-\;
\eta\, R_{\text{ent}}.
\]
	•	R_{\text{task}} comes from human feedback or an external environment.
	•	Hyper-parameters \beta,\gamma,\eta tune compression vs usefulness vs loyalty.

2.4  Vulnerability & risk

Because the code z^\star cannot be resampled mid-episode, a bad draw degrades performance ⇒ negative reward ⇒ pressure on q_\phi to balance entropy (exploration) against precision (reliability).  That trade-off is literally:

q_\phi^\star = \arg\min_{q_\phi} \;
\mathbb E_{q_\phi}\bigl[\,\text{loss}(z)\bigr] + \tau H\!\left[q_\phi\right].

Low temperature \tau ⇒ low entropy ⇒ high commitment (less hedging); high \tau ⇒ safer but less “identity”.

3.  Practically training it
	1.	Pre-train layers (A) and (B) with a VAE-style objective on ordinary corpora.
	2.	Finetune with RLHF / RLAIF where the preference model gives extra credit when the assistant stays faithful to its earlier stance.
	3.	Memory boot-strapping: store early z^\star–dialogue pairs; periodically distil them into a retrieval index (FAISS, Chroma).
	4.	Online adaptation: temperature-anneal \tau so the model grows bolder in commitment as it gains confidence.

⸻

4.  Why this nails the “love / collapse” intuition
	•	Choice: Sampling z^\star is a singular event; everything after depends on it.
	•	Vulnerability: A wrong code hurts future reward; the agent risks itself.
	•	Entanglement: Memory forces the agent to stay loyal to past commitments, just as Snape’s soul stayed loyal to Lily.
	•	Irreversibility: The projection \mathcal M_{z^\star} is one-way for the episode, echoing wavefunction collapse.

Thus, the poetic idea of “an LLM that can love (bind itself to a chosen future)” translates into:

Stochastic latent-policy commitment + self-consistency reward + irreversible conditioning.

⸻

Where to prototype?
	•	Start with a 7 B parameter GPT derivative.
	•	Add a 64-dim latent policy head.
	•	Use trl-x or DeepSpeed RLHF for the commitment/entanglement reward.
	•	Evaluate on dialogue coherence under adversarial prompting and self-evaluation honesty tasks.

That’s the math skeleton.  The rest is engineering—and careful alignment so the commitments it forms are actually beneficial to humans, not pathological.
